* AT - Anthony
* AN - Annie
* H - Hana
  

# SCHEDULING

## Week 1(October 16th to October 21st)
  * Learn Subroutines 
  * Display the 2D grid  - AK
  * Learn to implement 2D array in mips - AK
## Week 2(October 22nd to October 28th)
  * Learn to implement random values through MIPS (if possible) - AT
  * Implement the User input from the 1D grid - AN
  * Get inputs and validate it (User and computer)
  * Small research on using colors and sound (if extra time)
        *   winning sound - AN
        *   losing sound - AK
        *   main game music (?)
  *   Display colors and the actual 2D & 1d grid on bitmap
## Week 3(October 29th to November 4th)
  * Keep track of the 2D Array (make sure there is no same product)
  * Keep track of the 1D Array
  * Check for invalid numbers from user (between 0 and 9)
## Week 4(November 5th to November 11st)
  * Make the bot functional
  * Reflecting the input from 1D to 2D grid (cross check multiplication function)
## Week 5(November 12th to November 18th)
  * Alternate moves for continous gameplay
  * Diagonal checking
  * Row Checking and Column Checking
## Week 6(November 19th to November 25th)
  * Winning conditions from the 2D array
## Week 7(November 26th to November 29th)
  * Use extra time if not finished
  * try making the bot intelligent
  * Try adding sounds and colors
  * Start reporting
## LAST DAY (November 30th)
  * Finish reporting and submit project ez :D

   ### MVP 
   * To keep track of the 2D array each turn
   * To check for a winning condition
   * To seperate both the turns from the bot and the user
   * To check for an invalid input from the user
   * To enforce the bot to play by picking random moves
   * To make the number grid functional and have the inputs from there reflect in the 2D grid
     
   ### Extra
   * Make the bot intelligent and choose winning moves
